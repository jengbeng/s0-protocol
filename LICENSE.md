# S0 Invariant Commons License v1.0 (Medium-Strict)

This license governs the use, reproduction, modification, and distribution of the S₀ protocol, the stability levels S₁–S₇, the meta-architecture X, and all related documents in this repository (“the Work”).

Its purpose is to preserve the invariant structure of the S₀ protocol while allowing open, collective, and verifiable development.

---

## 1. Permissions

Subject is granted the right to:

- use the Work for any purpose (research, education, implementation, analysis),  
- copy and distribute the Work in any medium,  
- create derivative works for clarification, explanation, or extension,  
- contribute modifications to this repository.

These permissions are irrevocable and apply equally to all subjects.

---

## 2. Invariant Preservation Requirements

To maintain the correctness and neutrality of the S₀ protocol, derivative works **must NOT** alter or redefine the following invariant elements:

- S₀ axioms (A1–A8)  
- definition of the transition function **F**  
- threat classes **T₁–T₄**  
- stability levels **S₁–S₇**  
- meta-architecture X: **τ**, **ρ**, **δ**

Clarifications, reorganizations, proofs, examples, or explanatory material are allowed,  
**but must not introduce new axioms, new threat types, or alternative definitions that replace the invariant structure.**

Derivative works may extend the protocol only by **adding non-core layers**, provided they do not conflict with or override the invariant structure.

---

## 3. Attribution

All copies, modifications, or derivative works must include:

```
Based on the S₀ Protocol.
Original source: https://github.com/<YOUR-REPO>
License: S0 Invariant Commons License v1.0
```

---

## 4. Equal Rights and Anti-Monopolization

No subject may impose additional legal or technical restrictions that would:

- create privileged ownership over the Work,  
- prevent others from using, modifying, or distributing the Work,  
- limit access to the invariant structure,  
- require payments, permissions, or private licensing.

All subjects must remain equal in their rights to use and extend the Work.

---

## 5. Allowed Derivative Works

Derivative works are permitted only if they:

1. preserve the invariant structure (Section 2),  
2. remain fully open and publicly accessible,  
3. are released under this same license (S0 Invariant Commons License v1.0),  
4. clearly mark any additions or explanatory layers as non-core extensions.

Derivative works that alter the invariant structure **may not** use the name “S₀” or imply compatibility.

---

## 6. Contributions to This Repository

By submitting a contribution, Subject agrees that:

- the contribution becomes part of the Work,  
- it must comply with the invariant requirements in Section 2,  
- maintainers may edit contributions for clarity and structural consistency,  
- the semantic meaning of the invariant core is not to be changed.

---

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind.  
No subject shall be liable for any claim, damage, or liability arising from the use of the Work.

---

## 8. License Versioning

New versions of this license may be released to improve clarity or address legal gaps,  
but all versions must preserve the invariant requirements described in Section 2.

Subjects may choose to use any later version of this license.

---

## 9. Intent

This license is created to ensure:

- openness,  
- equality of participants,  
- structural correctness,  
- verifiability,  
- protection from semantic drift,  
- protection from privatization or enclosure,  
- compatibility with long-term collective development.

It balances freedom of use with the preservation of the invariant S₀ protocol.
